### Hello there! 
My name is Donald Bertucci (last name pronounced BURR-2-CHEE). My friends call me Donny. So you can call me Donny!

During the school year, I am an undergrad studying computer science at Oregon State University. I will be a junior next year school year! 

This summer, I'm being hosted and working with awesome people from Carnegie Mellon University's Data Interaction Group ([CMU DIG](https://dig.cmu.edu/)) as part of the HCII Summer Research Program.
