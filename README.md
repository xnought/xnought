### Hello there! 
My name is Donald Bertucci (last name pronounced BURR-TOO-CHEE) and I am studying computer science at Oregon State University. My friends call me Donny. So you can call me Donny!

This summer I'm being hosted and working with awesome people from Carnegie Mellon University's Data Interaction Group ([CMU DIG](https://dig.cmu.edu/)) as part of the HCII Summer Research Program.
